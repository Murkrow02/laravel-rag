# CLAUDE.md — working on `murkrow/laravel-rag`

Handoff notes for an AI agent continuing this package. Read `README.md` first for what it does; this file is about how it is built and what will bite you.

## Status

Complete and green. 202 tests, 696 assertions.

```bash
composer install
vendor/bin/pest                       # unit + feature on SQLite
vendor/bin/pest --testsuite=Pgvector  # needs a real PostgreSQL with pgvector
```

The pgvector suite skips itself when no database is reachable. Point it at one with
`RAG_TEST_PG_HOST` / `RAG_TEST_PG_PORT` (defaults: host `rag-test-pg`, port `5432`,
db `rag_test`, user/password `rag`/`rag`):

```bash
docker run -d --name rag-test-pg \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=rag -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=rag -e POSTGRES_DB=rag_test \
  -p 55432:5432 pgvector/pgvector:pg17
RAG_TEST_PG_HOST=127.0.0.1 RAG_TEST_PG_PORT=55432 vendor/bin/pest --testsuite=Pgvector
```

CI (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`) runs the full suite, pgvector included, against a
`pgvector/pgvector:pg17` service on every push and pull request. Every push to `main`
also runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which auto-tags the next patch version and
cuts a GitHub release; Packagist then publishes that tag. Bump the minor or major
yourself by pushing a `vX.Y.0` tag by hand when a release warrants it.

## The four invariants

Break any of these and the package stops being what it is.

**1. No host application classes.** Nothing under `src/` may name `App\Models\Book` or anything like it. Host models are reached only from a source class the *application* writes (`app/Knowledge/BookSource.php`, extending `EloquentSource`), listed as a class-string in `config/rag.php` under `sources`. The test fixtures (`tests/Fixtures/TestBook.php`, `TestBookSource.php`) exist to prove this: if they are enough to exercise every path, the package is genuinely generic.

**2. Optional integrations stay optional.** Filament, `laravel/mcp` and Scout are `require-dev` + `suggest`, never `require`. Every reference to them is behind `class_exists()` plus a config toggle, so a host without them boots normally and a breaking upgrade downstream degrades to "feature off" rather than a fatal error. `laravel/mcp` is a **beta**; treat its API as movable.

**3. Nothing touches the database during `register()`.** `migrate` has to run against a schema that does not exist yet. `SettingsRepository::available()` guards on `Schema::hasTable()` inside a try/catch for exactly this reason, and settings are applied in `$this->app->booted()`.

**4. The chunker is pure.** Same segments plus same options must always produce byte-identical text and hashes. `ChunkerBoundaryTest > it is deterministic across runs` pins this. If it ever fails, incremental re-ingestion silently becomes a full re-embed on every run — expensive and almost invisible.

## Shape of the thing

```
Source (class)   →  DocumentIngestor  →  Chunker  →  ChunkDiffer  →  ChunkEmbedder  →  VectorStore
                                                                                            ↓
                          Answerer  ←  PromptRenderer  ←  Retriever  ←────────────────────┘
```

- `src/Sources/` — `EloquentSource` (one row, one document) and `GroupedEloquentSource` (one *group* of rows, one document, for tables of thousands of short entries) are the abstract bases a host extends (model, `SegmentMap`, `PositionLabels`, `ChunkingOverrides`, filters); `ClosureKnowledgeSource` the escape hatch; `SourceRegistry` resolves the class-strings in `rag.sources` through the container. Filters are objects (`src/Sources/Filters/`, built via `Filter::ids(...)`) that own their own `apply()`, and the *same* object drives `--filter=`, the ingestion query and the Filament form — which is why nothing in `src/Sources/` may import Filament: the field mapping lives in `Filament/Forms/SourceFilterSchema`, keyed by `instanceof`, and an unknown filter class degrades to a text input.
- `src/Chunking/` — `SentenceSplitter` produces page-tagged sentences (with OCR hard-splitting and cross-page bridging); `SlidingWindowChunker` slides a token-budgeted window over them. Read the comments there before changing anything: the `max(1, $cut)` in `windows()` is a monotonicity guard, not defensive noise.
- `src/Ingestion/` — `ChunkDiffer` is the reason re-indexing is cheap. `RunProgress` uses atomic `incrementEach`, never read-modify-write, because several workers report on the same run.
- `src/VectorStores/` — only `PgVectorStore` ships. `AbstractVectorStore::baseQuery()` owns filter compilation for every driver.
- `src/Retrieval/`, `src/Answering/` — pipeline and grounding.
- `src/Filament/`, `src/Mcp/` — two optional surfaces.
- `src/Chat/`, `src/Http/`, `routes/chat.php`, `resources/views/chat/`, `resources/dist/` — the standalone chat page. Filament-free by construction: it is the surface for someone who wants an answer, not a retriever to tune. `ChatAbilities` is its whole authorization vocabulary; `ChatPayload` is the only thing that decides what reaches the browser.

## Decisions that look odd and are not

- **`content_hash` hashes the *embedding input*, not `content`.** The provenance header (document title + position label) is part of what gets embedded, so a title change must invalidate the vector. The header is stored on the chunk's `metadata.header` so `EmbeddingInput::for()` can rebuild it without knowing which run created the row.
- **`position_start` / `position_end` are real indexed columns.** Page-range filtering is a first-class feature and the overlap test (`position_start <= :to AND position_end >= :from`) has to be an index scan, not JSON extraction.
- **An empty filter list means "match nothing".** `whereIn(col, [])` compiles to `0 = 1`, which is what an empty MCP allow-list must do. This was a real bug once: `!== []` guards turned "expose nothing" into "expose everything". Do not reintroduce them.
- **`cost_micros` is an integer.** These are summed across millions of rows in SQL, where float accumulation drifts.
- **Ordering is on `embedding <=> :q`, not on `1 - (...) DESC`.** Ordering on the derived score defeats the HNSW index.
- **Vectors are L2-normalised on write.** Cosine similarity then equals the dot product, which makes MMR a single pass instead of three.
- **The model is never called when retrieval is empty.** An LLM handed no context answers from its parameters. `AnswererTest > it never calls the model when there is no context` pins this.
- **`QueryLog`, not `Query`.** A model named `Query` collides with Eloquent's static `query()`; `QueryCitation::queryLog()` cannot be called `query()` either — that is a fatal error, not a warning.
- **`ChunkDiffer` parks ordinals at +1,000,000,000 before renumbering.** The `(document_id, ordinal)` unique index would otherwise collide mid-update.
- **A window that consumed everything left does not carry an overlap forward.** `windows()` returns as soon as the emitted window covers the whole buffer and the sentence stream is exhausted. Without that guard every document ended with a chunk whose sentences had all already been emitted — an extra embedding per document and a near-duplicate hit at retrieval; short documents were worst, a 40-token epigraph produced three chunks. Look there first if chunk counts jump.
- **Config is merged recursively, not by `mergeConfigFrom`.** Laravel's merges the top level only, so a published `config/rag.php` would have to repeat every nested default or silently lose it. `mergeRagConfig()` merges deep with list arrays replaced wholesale (`Support\Arr::mergeConfig`), which is what lets the host file carry only its overrides — and why `rag.sources`, a list, replaces rather than appends.
- **A filter's name is not its column.** Two filters routinely narrow the same column (`ids` and `id_range` both hit `id`); the name is what `--filter=` and the form state path address, so `FilterSet` keys on it.
- **`Filter::boolean(..., default: false)` constrains every run.** `FilterSet` skips only blank values, and `false` is not blank. That is deliberate: "exclude the bad rows unless asked" is one line, and the toggle in the form is what opts back in.
- **`RagServiceProvider` registers pgvector's Blueprint macros itself.** pgvector's own provider does it, but is not discovered under Testbench or with discovery disabled.
- **Component views live in `resources/views/components/`, not under `filament/`.** With the `rag` view namespace registered, Laravel resolves `<x-rag::chunk-card />` to `rag::components.chunk-card`. An earlier version called `Blade::anonymousComponentNamespace('filament.components', 'rag')`, which resolves against the *application's* view paths — so it worked only in the test suite, whose base case had put the package's view directory on those paths. That was a false green; the test now asserts the view resolves by namespace instead.
- **Nothing polls unless a run is in flight.** The host panel here runs `AuthenticateSession`, and several Livewire components refreshing at once can race it into regenerating the session, leaving the other in-flight requests with a stale CSRF token — which the browser reports as "Page Expired", and refreshing re-arms the pollers into a loop. `ragPollIntervalWhileRunning()` and `LatestRunsTable::pollInterval()` return null when no run is active; `rag.filament.poll_interval` set to null disables polling entirely.
- **The chat's assets are served by a route, not published.** `publishes()` puts a copy in `public/` that nothing updates when the package does, and the failure mode is a page silently rendering against last month's CSS. `AssetController` streams them from `resources/dist/` with a content hash in the URL and a year-long immutable cache, so it costs one request per deploy. The publish tag still exists for hosts that would rather serve them.
- **The chat cannot reuse `x-rag::chunk-card`.** That component renders `<x-filament::badge>`/`<x-filament::icon>` and leans on Tailwind classes that only exist because Filament's build safelists them. The chat is a separate document with no Filament and no host Tailwind, so its passage card is a plain-CSS twin. Two renderers is the cost of the page working without a panel.
- **Chat ability defaults must not assume a `Gate::before` super-admin bypass.** The host here deliberately has none — several of its checks legitimately fail and must keep failing — so every default in `ChatAbilities::DEFAULTS` answers on its own. `all_conversations` is the only one that defaults to false.
- **A permission-name string is resolved before a callable in `ChatAbilities::resolve()`.** `is_callable()` is true for any string naming a global function, so checking callables first would turn a permission called `viewRag` into a call to `viewRag()`.
- **`AnswerOptions::withRetrieval()` and `withChannel()` rebuild positionally.** A new constructor argument that is not added to both is dropped silently. `AnswerOptionsTest` pins `conversationId`/`turn` for exactly this reason.
- **The chat's `conversation_id` foreign key is skipped on SQLite.** SQLite cannot attach one to a table that already exists, and the test suite runs on SQLite. `Conversation`'s `deleting` hook deletes the turns itself, so a deleted thread never leaves orphaned answers on either driver.
- **The chat's front end is plain DOM code, not Alpine or Livewire.** Livewire would make the package depend on it; Alpine is not on the page outside a Filament panel. A few hundred lines of vanilla JS is what lets the page work in a host with no build step at all.
- **`PrismLanguageModel::stream()` reads `$event->delta`, not `$event->text`.** Prism streams typed events (`TextDeltaEvent`, `StreamEndEvent`, ...); older releases yielded chunks with `text`. Reading only one shape yields zero deltas, an empty accumulated answer, and therefore an answer citing nothing -- which `looksRefused()` correctly reports as a refusal. The symptom is *every* streamed question refusing while the non-streaming path answers fine, and nothing in the suite catches it because `FakeLanguageModel` yields plain strings. `PrismStreamEventTest` pins both shapes.
- **Every inline SVG on the chat page needs an explicit size.** An `<svg>` with a `viewBox` and no width/height is 300x150, not "as tall as the text". `.rag svg` sets the default once; a new icon in a new context inherits it instead of blowing up the layout.
- **The collapsed sidebar is one grid column, not a zero-width first one.** `.rag-sidebar` is `display: none` when closed, so it stops being a grid item and `.rag-main` slides into whatever the first track is. A `0` first track therefore squeezes the conversation to nothing.
- **The chat's CSS custom properties live on `:root`.** They were on `.rag` once, and `body` is its *ancestor*: custom properties inherit downwards only, so every `var()` on `body` was invalid and the whole page fell back to the browser's default serif.
- **A conversation id is checked with `Str::isUuid()` before it reaches the query.** On PostgreSQL `rag_conversations.uuid` is a native `uuid`, so `where('uuid', 'undefined')` is not a miss -- it is `SQLSTATE[22P02]` and a 500. SQLite stores it as text and swallows this, so the Web suite cannot catch it; the guard is the test.
- **An unusable conversation id opens a new thread, it does not fail the request.** The id is a continuation hint. A deleted, pruned or corrupted one must never leave somebody on a page that refuses to answer anything, so `AskRequest` does not validate it as a uuid and `AskController::resolveConversation()` falls back to a fresh conversation.
- **The `job_batches` migration is dated `9999_12_31`.** It must run *after* every host migration so an application that publishes its own always wins and ours no-ops. Dated normally it created the table first and made the host's migration fail with a duplicate-table error — which is exactly what happened in this repo.

## Testing notes

| Suite | Runs on |
|---|---|
| `Unit` | nothing — pure functions, no app boot |
| `Feature` | SQLite + `InMemoryVectorStore` + fake embedding/LLM |
| `Filament` | SQLite + a real Filament panel via `FilamentTestCase` |
| `Web` | SQLite + session + a logged-in user via `WebTestCase`, deliberately with **no** Filament |
| `Pgvector` | real PostgreSQL, skipped when unreachable |

- `McpToolsTest::seedForMcp()` shrinks `target_tokens` and `min_tokens` on purpose: its pages are two sentences long, and with the shipped 512-token target they land in one chunk spanning both pages, which would make the page-range assertion vacuous.
- The feature suite ingests `tests/Fixtures/TestBookSource` and, for the grouped shape, `TestTitleIndexSource`; `rag.sources` holds its class-string. `SourceRegistry` memoises what it resolved, so a test that rewrites `rag.sources` mid-case must call `SourceRegistry::flush()` — that is the only reason the method exists.
- `TestCase::defineEnvironment()` sets `rag.retrieval.min_score` to `0.0`. `FakeEmbeddingProvider` is deterministic but not semantic, so the score floor tuned for a real model would reject everything.
- `QueuedIngestionTest` uses the **database** queue driver and `drainQueue()`, not `sync`. The sync driver runs batch jobs inside `Batch::add()`, before the pending count settles, so completion callbacks never fire the way they do in production — which is precisely the behaviour under test.
- `getPackageProviders()` deliberately omits `PgvectorServiceProvider`: it ships a `CREATE EXTENSION` migration SQLite cannot run.
- Filament widgets use `protected ?string $pollingInterval` — **not** `static`. Redeclaring the parent's non-static property as static is a fatal error.
- Livewire component state must be scalars or arrays. `IngestKnowledge::$estimate` is an array for this reason, not the DTO the planner returns.

## Where to look when something is wrong

| Symptom | Look at |
|---|---|
| Search returns nothing | `rag:status` for stale vectors; `retrieval.min_score`; whether the model changed |
| Answers are ungrounded | `resources/views/prompts/system.blade.php`; `require_citations`; `QueryResource` for which citations went unused |
| Re-ingestion re-embeds everything | chunker determinism; `params_checksum`; whether a chunking parameter or the title changed |
| A run stalls at some percentage | is a worker consuming `rag.queue.queue`; `IngestionRun::failedJobs()`; run items with `status = failed` |
| Queries are slow | is there an ANN index (`rag:status` warns); `hnsw.ef_search`; are filters narrowing before ranking |
| Chunks span the wrong pages | `SentenceSplitter` bridging; `ChunkerBoundaryTest` |
| The chat page 500s for a guest | the host's login route is not *named* `login`; set `rag.chat.middleware` |
| A chat control is missing | its `rag.chat.<ability>`; remember `ChatPayload` omits denied values entirely |
| The chat answers but saves nothing | `rag.retrieval.log_queries`, and `rag.chat.abilities.history` |
| Every question errors, none reach the model | is the embedder reachable? `rag.embeddings` is called on *every query*, not just at ingestion |
| The chat streams nothing under Octane | a worker's `flush()` may never reach the client; set `rag.answering.stream` to false for one plain XHR instead |
| Every streamed question refuses | `PrismLanguageModel::stream()` and the shape of Prism's events; compare against the non-streaming path |

## Not built (deliberately)

- Only one vector driver. The `VectorStore` contract exists so a second is one class, not a refactor.
- No re-ranker model. MMR and de-duplication cover most of the benefit; a cross-encoder would be a new `Retriever`.
- No conversational memory beyond `AnswerOptions::$history`, which is passed straight to the prompt.
- `PruneOrphanChunksJob` exists but is not scheduled. Ingestion only walks what the source still returns, so it cannot notice deletions; schedule it nightly on a corpus that gets pruned.
