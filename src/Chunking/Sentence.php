 * Internal unit of the chunker: one sentence, tagged with the segment (page)
 * it belongs to and its offsets in the virtual document.
 *
 * `position` and `positionEnd` differ only for a bridged sentence -- one that
 * was cut in half by a page break and stitched back together. Every other
 * sentence belongs to exactly one page, which is what makes chunk page ranges
 * exact rather than estimated.
 *
 * Offsets are byte offsets into the normalized, newline-joined document. For
 * Latin-script text they are within a couple of percent of character offsets.
