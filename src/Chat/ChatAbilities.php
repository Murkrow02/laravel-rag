 * a Blade template. The abilities are registered as ordinary Gate abilities
 * named `rag.chat.<name>`, which means a host can override any of them the
 * way it overrides anything else -- Gate::define, a policy, spatie's
 * permission strings -- without the package knowing about it.
 *
 * The resolution order is deliberate:
 *
 *   1. an ability the host has already defined on the Gate wins outright;
 *   2. otherwise config('rag.chat.abilities.<name>') decides;
