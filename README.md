A configuration-driven RAG toolkit for Laravel: chunking, embeddings, pgvector retrieval, grounded answering, an MCP server and a Filament control panel.

The package knows nothing about your models. You describe them once in `config/rag.php` — a model, a relation that yields ordered text, a couple of columns — and everything else follows: ingestion, incremental re-indexing, semantic search with page-accurate citations, a chat endpoint, an MCP server for external agents, and a dashboard to drive it all.

```php
Rag::ask('Who convened the council, and when?')->answer;
// "The podestà Guido Novello convened the general council in March. [#1]"
```

## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| PHP | 8.2+ |
| Laravel | 12 or 13 |
| Database | **PostgreSQL with the `vector` extension** (pgvector 0.5+) |
| Embeddings & generation | any provider [Prism](https://prismphp.com) supports — OpenAI, Ollama, VoyageAI, Bedrock, Mistral… |
| Optional | `filament/filament` ^4 for the panel, `laravel/mcp` ^1 for the MCP server, `laravel/scout` for hybrid retrieval |

The easiest way to get pgvector is the official image: `pgvector/pgvector:pg17`. A stock `postgres:17` does **not** ship the extension.

If you already have data in an Alpine-based Postgres, do **not** simply swap in that image: it is Debian/glibc, and mounting a musl-built `PGDATA` under a different libc changes collation and can corrupt indexes on text columns. Either dump and restore, or build the extension onto the base you already run:

```dockerfile
FROM postgres:17-alpine
RUN apk add --no-cache --virtual .build build-base git postgresql17-dev \
    && git clone --branch v0.8.1 --depth 1 https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector.git /tmp/pgvector \
    && cd /tmp/pgvector \
    && make USE_PGXS=1 with_llvm=no && make USE_PGXS=1 with_llvm=no install \
    && cd / && rm -rf /tmp/pgvector && apk del .build
```

---

## Installation

```bash
composer require murkrow/laravel-rag
php artisan rag:install     # verifies the extension, publishes the config
php artisan migrate
```

`rag:install` tells you, in plain language, what is missing before anything else can go wrong — a database that cannot host vectors, a missing `job_batches` table, a corpus with no source configured.

Add your provider key and pick your models:

```dotenv
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

RAG_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai
RAG_EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small
RAG_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS=1536
RAG_LLM_PROVIDER=openai
RAG_LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini

RAG_QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis
RAG_QUEUE=rag
```

Then run a worker for the ingestion queue:

```bash
php artisan queue:work redis --queue=rag,default
```

Your `config/rag.php` only needs the keys you actually change: the package's defaults are merged underneath it recursively, so overriding one nested value never drops its siblings. Publish the full, commented file when you want to read the defaults:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=rag-config     # every default, documented
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=rag-stubs      # the source stub rag:make:source writes
```

---

## Describing your data

A **source** maps one Eloquent model to a document, and an ordered relation to that document's text segments. It is a class, and it is the only place your own models appear.

```bash
php artisan rag:make:source BookSource --model=App\\Models\\Book --relation=pages --text=content --position=number
```

```php
// app/Knowledge/BookSource.php
namespace App\Knowledge;

use App\Models\Book;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Murkrow\Rag\Sources\{EloquentSource, Filter, PositionLabels, SegmentMap};

final class BookSource extends EloquentSource
{
    public function key(): string          { return 'books'; }   // stored on every document
    public function label(): string        { return 'Library'; }
    public function icon(): ?string        { return 'heroicon-o-book-open'; }

    protected function model(): string     { return Book::class; }
    protected function keyColumn(): string { return 'id'; }      // becomes external_id
    protected function titleColumn(): ?string { return 'title'; }
    protected function metadata(): array   { return ['author', 'isbn']; }

    protected function segmentMap(): SegmentMap
    {
        return SegmentMap::relation('pages', text: 'content', position: 'number', batchSize: 200);
    }

    /** How a citation reads. */
    protected function positionLabels(): PositionLabels
    {
        return new PositionLabels('Pages :start-:end', 'Page :start');
    }

    /** Only index what is worth indexing. */
    protected function scope(Builder $query): void
    {
        $query->whereNotNull('published_at');
    }

    /** Drives both `--filter=` on the CLI and the ingestion form. */
    protected function filters(): iterable
    {
        return [
            Filter::ids('ids', 'id', label: 'Specific IDs'),
            Filter::range('id_range', 'id', label: 'ID range'),
            Filter::like('title', label: 'Title contains'),
            Filter::boolean('bad_ocr', label: 'Include badly scanned books', default: false),
        ];
    }

    /** Deep link back into your app. */
    public function url(Document $document, ?Chunk $chunk = null): ?string
    {
        return route('books.show', ['book' => $document->external_id, 'page' => $chunk?->position_start]);
    }
}
```

Then list it — the only knowledge configuration there is:

```php
// config/rag.php
'sources' => [
    App\Knowledge\BookSource::class,
],
```

Sources are resolved through the container, so a source may take constructor dependencies, and it is a plain object you can instantiate in a test.

`position` is the number a human would cite — a page, a section, a timestamp in seconds. It ends up on every chunk and in every citation, so pick something meaningful. A model that carries its whole text in one column says `SegmentMap::column('body')` instead.

### Filters

Every filter is one object, applied by the ingestion query, parsed from `--filter=name:value`, and rendered as the matching field in the Filament form:

| Factory | Accepts | Becomes |
|---|---|---|
| `Filter::ids('ids', 'id')` | `"1,2,3"`, `[1, 2, 3]` | `whereIn` |
| `Filter::range('id_range', 'id')` | `"10-50"`, `"10..50"`, `['from' =>, 'to' =>]` | inclusive bounds |
| `Filter::dateRange('published', 'published_at')` | the same shapes | `whereDate` bounds |
| `Filter::like('title')` | `"garibaldi"` | `like %value%` |
| `Filter::in('lang', ['it' => 'Italian'])` | a list | `whereIn` + multi-select |
| `Filter::boolean('bad_ocr', default: false)` | truthy / falsy | `where(col, bool)` |
| `Filter::isNull('orphans', 'author')` | truthy / falsy | `whereNull` / `whereNotNull` |
| `Filter::callback('recent', fn ($q, $v) => $q->recent($v))` | anything | your closure |

The first argument is the filter's name — what `--filter=` addresses — and the column defaults to it, which is why two filters can narrow the same column. A blank value means "not filtered"; `false` is not blank, so `default: false` constrains every run until someone toggles it. Write your own by implementing `SourceFilter`.

Per-source chunking is typed too, and only what you set is overridden:

```php
protected function chunkingOverrides(): ChunkingOverrides
{
    return new ChunkingOverrides(targetTokens: 320, overlapTokens: 40);
}
```

### Rows too small to be documents

A table of thousands of short rows -- a gazetteer, a glossary, a term list -- is the wrong shape for one-row-one-document: each vector would carry a handful of tokens and they would all look alike. `GroupedEloquentSource` groups the rows instead: a grouping expression's distinct values become the documents, and the rows inside a group become its ordered segments, so each chunk holds dozens of related entries.

```php
final class ToponymSource extends GroupedEloquentSource
{
    public function key(): string           { return 'toponyms'; }

    protected function model(): string      { return Toponym::class; }
    protected function groupBy(): string    { return 'upper(substr(name, 1, 1))'; }  // one document per initial
    protected function textColumn(): string { return 'name'; }

    protected function documentTitle(string $group): string
    {
        return "Toponyms - {$group}";
    }

    public function chunkingOverrides(): ChunkingOverrides
    {
        // Entries are independent: no fact spans a boundary, so overlap is
        // pure cost -- and bridging would stitch the whole letter into one
        // sentence, since names carry no closing punctuation.
        return new ChunkingOverrides(targetTokens: 256, overlapTokens: 0, bridgeSegments: false);
    }
}
```

Positions are ordinals inside the group, so a citation reads "Toponyms - S, entries 120-210". The grouping expression is interpolated into the query: it belongs to the source class and must never come from a request. Filters here select which *documents* a run covers -- a group that matches is ingested whole.

**Not an Eloquent model?** Build a source at runtime:

```php
Rag::source('handbook')
    ->setLabel('Employee handbook')
    ->loadDocumentsUsing(fn (array $filters) => LazyCollection::make(/* … DocumentDraft … */))
    ->loadSegmentsUsing(function (string $id): Generator { yield new Segment(1, $text); })
    ->register();
```

---

## Indexing

```bash
php artisan rag:ingest books                      # queued, incremental
php artisan rag:ingest books --sync                # in this process
php artisan rag:ingest books --dry-run             # estimate only
php artisan rag:ingest books --filter=id_range:1-50
php artisan rag:ingest books --mode=full           # re-chunk everything
php artisan rag:ingest books --mode=embeddings_only
```

`--dry-run` answers the question worth asking first:

```
  source ............................. Library (books)
  documents .......................... 1,240
  estimated chunks ................... ~48,000
  estimated tokens ................... ~24,600,000
  estimated cost ..................... ~$0.4920
```

### Incremental re-indexing is the default, and it is cheap

Chunks are matched by a hash of their embedding input. Re-running an ingestion over a corpus where one page changed re-embeds the chunks covering that page and **keeps every other vector**. A nightly `rag:ingest books` over an unchanged library costs nothing and finishes in seconds.

Three things invalidate a chunk: its text, the document title (it is part of the embedded context header), and the chunking parameters. All three are captured in the hash, so the system can never quietly serve a stale mixture.

### Chunking

Text is split into sentence-aligned windows with overlap, which sounds ordinary and is not, because the input is usually worse than prose:

- **Windows overlap.** A fact stated across a chunk boundary still appears intact in at least one chunk.
- **Sentences are stitched across segment boundaries.** A sentence cut in half by a page break is rejoined, and the resulting chunk honestly reports `Pages 12-13`.
- **Page ranges are exact, not estimated.** Every sentence carries its page, so `position_start` and `position_end` fall out of the window rather than being guessed.
- **OCR without punctuation is handled.** A scanned page with no full stops would otherwise arrive as one enormous "sentence"; it is split on whitespace instead.
- **Ligatures, hyphenation and control characters are normalised.** `ﬁ` becomes `fi`, `paro-\nla` becomes `parola`, and the replacement character disappears — all of which matter because they otherwise tokenise as garbage.
- **Stub chunks are merged backwards.** A 20-token trailing fragment scores high on similarity while saying nothing.

Every parameter is configurable per source, and the chunker is deterministic: the same input always produces the same hashes, which is what makes incremental indexing trustworthy.

## Searching and answering

```php
use Murkrow\Rag\Facades\Rag;
use Murkrow\Rag\Data\{AnswerOptions, RetrievalOptions};

// Retrieval only — no model call, no cost.
$chunks = Rag::search('who convened the council?');

// Grounded answer with citations.
$result = Rag::ask('who convened the council?', new AnswerOptions(
    retrieval: new RetrievalOptions(
        sourceKeys:   ['books'],
        externalIds:  ['42'],       // one book
        positionFrom: 10,           // pages 10–20
        positionTo:   20,
        topK:         6,
    ),
));

$result->answer;                    // the text
$result->refused;                   // true when the corpus could not support it
$result->usedCitations();           // only the ones the model actually cited
$result->usage->costUsd();
```

Streaming:

```php
$stream = Rag::stream($question);

foreach ($stream as $delta) {
    echo $delta;
}

$result = $stream->getReturn();
```

### The retrieval pipeline

Over-fetch → optional lexical fusion → score floor → de-duplication → MMR → optional neighbour expansion → top-k.

Two stages earn particular mention. **De-duplication is mandatory, not cosmetic**: adjacent chunks deliberately share their overlap, so a passage on a boundary reliably matches twice, and without collapsing them half your context window is the same paragraph. **MMR** trades a little relevance for coverage, because eight paraphrases of one passage are worth barely more than one.

Filters compile to SQL and run inside the ranking query, so a question scoped to one book touches only that book's vectors. For anything the declarative filters cannot express, `RetrievalOptions::$constrain` takes a closure over the Eloquent builder.

### Grounding

The system prompt is a publishable Blade view. The default is deliberately strict: answer only from the numbered context blocks, cite every claim as `[#n]`, refuse rather than speculate, never invent a page number, and quote OCR text as it is rather than silently correcting it.

Two guardrails are enforced in code rather than trusted to the model: **when retrieval returns nothing the model is never called at all** (an LLM handed no context will answer from its parameters, which is the exact failure a grounded system exists to prevent), and an answer citing nothing is treated as ungrounded and reported as a refusal.

```bash
php artisan rag:search "chi era il podestà" --source=books --from=40 --to=60
php artisan rag:ask "chi era il podestà" --stream
php artisan rag:status
```

### Hybrid retrieval (optional)

Embeddings are weakest at exactly what lexical search is best at: names, dates, catalogue numbers, rare proper nouns. Set `RAG_HYBRID_DRIVER=tsvector` to fuse a PostgreSQL full-text leg into the ranking with reciprocal rank fusion, or `scout` to use whichever engine Scout is already configured with.

---

## MCP server

With `laravel/mcp` installed, the package registers a server automatically — no route file to publish.

| | |
|---|---|
| `search_knowledge` | semantic search, filterable by source, document and position range |
| `fetch_document` | read a contiguous span around a hit |
| `answer_question` | full server-side RAG with citations |
| `documents` (resource) | what is indexed, so a client can discover identifiers before searching |
| `grounded_answer` (prompt) | instructions for a client that drives retrieval itself |

Rename the tools to suit your domain — the name is most of what a model uses to decide whether to reach for a tool:

```dotenv
RAG_MCP_TOOL_SEARCH=search_books_knowledge
RAG_MCP_WEB_PATH=mcp/knowledge
```

```bash
php artisan mcp:inspector knowledge
claude mcp add --transport http knowledge https://your-app.test/mcp/knowledge
```

Restrict what MCP can reach with `rag.mcp.sources`. An empty allow-list exposes nothing.

---

## Filament panel

```php
// app/Providers/Filament/AdminPanelProvider.php
->plugin(\Murkrow\Rag\Filament\RagPlugin::make())
```

Add `'Knowledge'` to your panel's `navigationGroups()`, or point `rag.filament.navigation_group` at a group you already have. Then give the panel a theme -- see below, it is not optional.

### The panel needs a custom theme

The pages here are ordinary Blade views styled with Tailwind utilities. Filament ships a *precompiled* stylesheet that carries only its own semantic `fi-*` classes, so `grid-cols-4`, `text-sm`, `prose` and the rest are simply not in it. Without a theme of your own the Knowledge pages render as unstyled markup: nothing errors, no asset 404s, the page just looks broken.

Build a panel theme whose Tailwind source includes this package's views:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-theme admin
```

Add one `@source` line to the generated `resources/css/filament/admin/theme.css`:

```css
@import '../../../../vendor/filament/filament/resources/css/theme.css';

@source '../../../../app/Filament/**/*';
@source '../../../../resources/views/filament/**/*';
@source '../../../../vendor/murkrow/laravel-rag/resources/views/**/*';
```

Register it on the panel, then build:

```php
->viteTheme('resources/css/filament/admin/theme.css')
```

```bash
npm run build
```

Two things that catch people out. `make:filament-theme` shells out to Node and aborts with `Node.js is not installed` if the machine running it has none -- which is normal when artisan runs inside a multi-stage container that only installs Node in the builder stage. The command does nothing you cannot do by hand: write the CSS above and add it to the `input` array in `vite.config.js` yourself. And the theme is a build artifact, so it has to be rebuilt on deploy like any other asset; a stale `public/build` shows the same unstyled pages.


- **Overview** — documents, chunks, coverage, chunks awaiting embedding, stale vectors, spend to date, throughput and per-source coverage.
- **Ingest knowledge** — pick a source, narrow it with the filters you declared, see the estimate, launch the run.
- **Ingestion runs** — live progress, per-document outcomes, cancel, retry failed jobs.
- **Documents** — coverage per document, the chunks it produced, their page ranges, re-index on demand.
- **Playground** — ask a question and see exactly what was retrieved: score, rank, page, and whether the model actually cited it.
- **Settings** — retrieval and prompt tuning, editable at runtime.

Every page and resource is individually switchable in config, and `rag.filament.authorize` takes a closure if the panel should not be open to everyone.

Nothing polls unless an ingestion is actually running. That is deliberate: panels that use Laravel's `AuthenticateSession` middleware can have several simultaneously refreshing Livewire components race it into regenerating the session, which surfaces in the browser as a "Page Expired" loop. Set `rag.filament.poll_interval` to `null` to disable refreshing altogether.

---

## Chat page

A standalone chat UI, served by the package and independent of Filament: its
own route, its own stylesheet, its own layout. It exists because the Playground
is a diagnostic tool -- single-shot, no memory, every retrieval knob on the
form -- and most people asking the corpus a question want an answer and a way
to check it, not a retriever to tune.

```
/rag/chat
```

Nothing to publish and nothing to build. Set `RAG_CHAT_PATH` to move it,
`RAG_CHAT_ENABLED=false` to switch it off.

- **Conversations are saved per user** and listed in the sidebar, grouped by
  day, renameable, pinnable, deletable. Each turn is still an ordinary
  `QueryLog` row -- citations, tokens and cost included -- with a
  `conversation_id` on it, so the query log stays the single audit trail.
- **The answer streams.** Citation markers become clickable pills; clicking one
  opens the sources panel on that exact passage, with its document, its page
  range, its similarity score and whether the model actually cited it.
- **Advanced settings are behind a button.** The main surface carries the
  question box, the model and the sources. `top_k`, `min_score` and
  retrieval-only mode live in a modal.
- **Thumbs up / down** writes `rag_queries.feedback`, which is the evaluation
  signal the query log was built to collect.

### Who sees what

Every control maps to an ability named `rag.chat.<name>`:

| Ability | Controls | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `view` | reaching the page at all | on |
| `history` | the sidebar, and saving conversations | on |
| `delete` | renaming, pinning and deleting one's own | on |
| `model` | the model picker and the model label | on |
| `sources` | the knowledge-source picker | on |
| `passages` | the sources panel and the citation pills | on |
| `cost` | per-answer cost, tokens, conversation total | on |
| `advanced` | `top_k`, `min_score`, retrieval-only | on |
| `feedback` | thumbs up / down | on |
| `export` | copying a conversation | on |
| `all_conversations` | reading somebody else's | **off** |

Each takes one of four shapes in `config/rag.php`:

```php
'chat' => [
    'abilities' => [
        'advanced' => false,                          // a literal
        'cost' => 'see rag costs',                     // a permission name, checked with $user->can()
        'view' => [RagPolicy::class, 'canAccess'],     // any callable: fn (?Authenticatable $user): bool
        'model' => null,                               // the package default
    ],
],
```

`Gate::define('rag.chat.cost', ...)` in your own provider overrides all of it.

Two things are worth knowing. **A closure here cannot be `config:cache`d** --
use a `[Policy::class, 'method']` array, which is callable and survives
`var_export()`. And the check is not cosmetic: a field whose ability is denied
is stripped from the request before validation
(`Http\Requests\AskRequest::prepareForValidation()`), so posting `top_k=30` by
hand to an account that may not tune retrieval gets the configured default.

### Notes

- **Saved history needs the query log.** With `rag.retrieval.log_queries` off
  there is no turn to reopen, so the page answers normally and hides the
  sidebar rather than showing one that never fills.
- **Streaming follows `rag.answering.stream`.** Turn it off and the endpoint
  returns the whole answer in one JSON response instead of server-sent events
  -- worth doing if your application server buffers streamed responses.
- **Authentication is `rag.chat.middleware`**, `['web', 'auth']` by default.
  An application whose login route is not *named* `login` (a Filament panel's
  is `filament.<panel>.auth.login`) must say so here, or Laravel's `auth`
  middleware cannot build its redirect for a guest.
- The stylesheet and script are served from inside the package by a route, not
  published, so they can never be a stale copy in `public/`. Publish them with
  `--tag=rag-chat-assets` if you would rather serve them yourself.

---

## Operating it

```bash
php artisan rag:status              # coverage, stale vectors, recent runs, spend
php artisan rag:status --watch
php artisan rag:sources
php artisan rag:make:source BookSource --model=App\\Models\\Book
php artisan rag:vector:reindex      # rebuild the ANN index after a bulk load
php artisan rag:purge books --embeddings-only
```

**Build the index after a bulk load, not before.** `rag:vector:reindex` drops and rebuilds it, which produces a better graph and is substantially faster than incremental inserts. Raise `maintenance_work_mem` first on a large corpus.

**Changing the embedding model invalidates every vector.** Vectors from two models are not comparable, and a pgvector column has a fixed width. The change is a deployment, not a setting: update the config, run `rag:vector:reindex`, then `rag:ingest <source> --mode=embeddings_only`. `rag:status` reports how many vectors are stale so the condition is visible rather than silent.

### Cost

Roughly, for a 1,000-book library of ~250 pages each at ~350 tokens per page:

| | |
|---|---|
| Source tokens | ~87M |
| Chunks at 512 tokens, 15% overlap | ~200,000 |
| Full index with `text-embedding-3-small` | **~$2** |
| Incremental re-run, nothing changed | $0 |

The dominant cost is wall-clock time against the provider's API, not money. Batches of 96 chunks per request and parallel workers are what move that number; the built-in rate limiter keeps a bulk run from burning its retry budget against a 429.

---

## Extending it

Everything behind a contract can be replaced by binding your own implementation:

| Contract | Default | Why you might swap it |
|---|---|---|
| `VectorStore` | `PgVectorStore` | another vector database |
| `EmbeddingProvider` | Prism | an in-house inference service |
| `LanguageModel` | Prism | a bespoke client |
| `Chunker` | `SlidingWindowChunker` | structure-aware splitting |
| `Retriever` / `Answerer` | defaults | a different pipeline |
| `LexicalSearch` | none | your own keyword engine |
| `TokenEstimator` | heuristic | `TiktokenEstimator` for exact counts |

For tests, `FakeEmbeddingProvider` and `FakeLanguageModel` make the whole pipeline runnable with no API key and no network.

---

## Testing the package

```bash
composer install
vendor/bin/pest                       # unit + feature on SQLite
vendor/bin/pest --testsuite=Pgvector  # needs a real PostgreSQL with pgvector
```

The pgvector suite skips itself when no database is reachable. Point it somewhere with:

```dotenv
RAG_TEST_PG_HOST=localhost
RAG_TEST_PG_PORT=55432
```

```bash
docker run -d --name rag-test-pg -e POSTGRES_USER=rag -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=rag \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=rag_test -p 55432:5432 pgvector/pgvector:pg17
```

CI runs the whole suite, pgvector included, on PHP 8.2–8.4 for every push and pull request.
